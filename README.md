# dice_game

Hello! 
This is my first ever python code!

This is part of my current "mini goals series" where I'll create 10 small python projects to practice what I have learnt.

This mini project is inspired by a youtuber named Mosh from "Python Projects for Beginners â€“ Master Problem-Solving! ðŸš€"
The URL for that video: " https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVl_G-F7m8c 

How it works (based on Mash's video)
1. Prompt if user would like to roll the dice
2. If no, game replies "Okay, bye!"
3. If yes, game replies "You've rolled: (___,___)"

Add features: 
1. Add a loop to keep asking until a valid input was given
2. Let the player roll untill they choose not to
